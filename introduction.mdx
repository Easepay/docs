Easepay offers a powerful REST API that supports bitcoin lightning network and standard on-chain operations with action events associated allowing you to receive and send bitcoin transactions instantly.

Our API uses HTTP response codes and returns all error responses in JSON. To explore the API as much as possible, we offer a developer environment in addition to production. Any operations made in the development environment use the Bitcoin's testnet network as well as Lightning infrastructure connected to testnet full nodes.

Development and production environments require separate API Keys that can be generated in your personal dashboard settings.

1. Getting historical Bitcoin data for your data-driven 
  applications(using our confluent kafka connect)
